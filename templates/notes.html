					<h2 class="header">Internet</h2>
					<p class="style">The internet works by useing its own unique language called HTTP.<br>
					The process starts by you opening up a browser like<a class="link" href="https://www.google.com/"> Google</a>             <br> 
					the browser then sends a request to the server finds the 	HTML<br> 
					document and sends it back to the browser.<br>
					The browser then interprets that information and desplays in on <br>
					the users screen.<br>

					<h2 class="header">HTML</h2>
					<p class="style">HTML documents are what most on the web is madeup of.<br>
					HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. <br>
					It contains text that make up what you see and links to documents<br> 
					that make up how you see it as well.<br>

					Images-IMG <span class="code"> <b class="bold">   &lt;img scr=&quot;URL&quot;&gt;</b></span><br>
					Tags are also madeup of either<em> <b class="bold">Inline</b> or <b class="bold">Block.</b></em>

					  mistake it can cause a major problems for the program.<br>
					  See a human would be able to see that mistake and quickly <br>
					  and logicly fix it.

			you would be the computer following the instructions and the your phone or list <br>

						<p class="style">What is a Variable? A variable <br>
							to programmers is a way they to give <em>names</em><br>
							to values. It helps programmers stay organized <br>
							when writing lots of code. It is also a way to <br>
							re-use certian information.<br>
							<br>
							If I use <span class="code"><b class="bold"> work</b> </span> as the variable <br>
							and the value of that variable equal to <span class="code"><b class="bold">10</b></span>.<br>
							The following code <br>
							<span class="code"><span class="print">print</span><b class="python"> work + work

		<div class="content3">
			<h2 class="header">Value</h2>
					<p class="style">What is a value in terms of programming?<br>
					A value is what the variable points to its very important <br>
					that you don't say equal to because it does not always deal <br>
					with numbers when creating Code. For instance say I have the <br>
					variable <span class="code"><b class="bold">name</b></span> and 
					I set the value of that to <span class="code"><b class="bold">Micah Judy</b></span>.<br>
					You see the variable just points to the value in this case <br>
					which is <span class="code"><b class="bold">Micah Judy</b></span>.
					How do you set a variable a value? Like this<br>
					<span class="code"><b class="bold">name = "Micah Judy"</b></span>.<br>
					Then to use this you Run this code <br>
					<span class="code"><span class="print">print</span><b class="python"> name</b></span>
					which would give you the output of<br>
					<span class="code"><b class="bold">Micah Judy</b></span>.

					<h2 class="header">Functions</h2>
					<p class="style">Also called procedures Functions take inputs, defines <br>
					 what to do with the input, and produces and output. To give you and <br>
						example the  function called <span class="code"><b class="bold">square</b></span>
						you could take the input <br>
						<span class="code"><b class="bold">5</b></span> define it to mutiply the input by

		<div class="content3">
			<h2 class="header">Making Functions</h2>
				<p class="style"> Functions are made in Python using the code <br>
				<span class="code"><b class="bold">def</b></span> then you have to give  
				that function a name <span class="code"><b class="bold">square</b></span><br>
				then you have to define it using parameters which are inside parentheses. <br>
				the paremeters will eventually be replaced with values once to difine the <br>
				Function. In the body of the function is where we write code that defines <br>
				what to do with the paremeters(inputs). Example <br>
				<br>
				<br>
					<div class="code-block">
			  		<span class="print">def</span> square(n): <br>
            <span class="indent">answer = n * n</span> <br>
            <span class="indent"><span class="print">print</span> answer</span>
					</div>		
			</p>
		  
		</div>
		<div class="content3">
			<h2 class="header">Using Functions</h2>
				<p class="style">
				  Once you have made your function and have defined what you <br>
					want it to do you can use it like this <br>
					<br>
					<span class="code"><span class="print">print</span><b class="bold"> square
						(5) </b></span><br>
					your answer should be <span class="code"><b class="bold">25</b></span><br>
					<br>
					Once you have have made your function and defined what you want it to do <br>
					you are able you re-use it over and over again. Because you are able to <br>
					re-use functions this helps programmers avoid repetition when creating <br>
					code. Making for less mistakes and headaches later.

			<h2 class="header">Loops</h2>
					<p class="style"> When coding in Python one of the major conccepts <br>
						that you use are Loops. A Loop is code that repeats that code <br>
						over and over again until the code either becomes False or <br>
						you add a Break parameter. This also helps programmers avoid <br>
						repetition. Example of Loop Code  <br>
						<br>
						<br>
								<div class="code-block">
									<span>i = 0</span> <br>
			  					<span class="print">while</span> i &#60; 25: <br>

			<h1 class="title" id="7">Lesson 7 - Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
				<h2 class="header">Object-Oriented Programming </h2>
					<p class="style">Object-Oriented Programming or OPP for short focuses  on using <br> <b class="bold"> Objects</b> rather then <b class="bold"> Actions</b>. Its designed to make coding easyer<br>
					for programmers. OOP languages used are <b class="bold">Java, Python, C++,<br> Visual Basic .NET and Ruby</b>. So what is an Object in OOP? <br>
					Well think of each Object as a small program able to preform <br>
					a couple of operations. By by its self it might not do that  much<br>
					but combine matiple objects together and you are able to create very <br>
					complex programs. OOP makes use of one of the key concepts you keep <br>
					hearing Remember <b class="bold">&#34;Avoinding Repetition&#34;</b> also helps programmers <br>save time.<br>
						<br>
						Major conepts in OOP<br>
						 <ol>
			   				<li class="list">Inheritance</li>
			   				<li class="list">Method Over-Riding</li>
					  </ol>
					</p>
					<p class="style">
					<b class="bold"> Inheritance -</b> is when an object or class is based on another object &#40;prototypal inheritance&#41;<br> or class &#40;class-based inheritance&#41;, using the same implementation <br>&#40;inheriting from an object or class&#41; specifying implementation<br> to maintain the same behavior.<br>
					<br>
					<b class="bold"> Method Over-Riding - </b> is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class<br> to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of<br> its superclasses or parent classes.
					<br>
					<br>
						<b class="bold">Check out this great video explaining OOP</b><br>
						<a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS-9y0H3Si8">Video</a>
				
					</p>
				<h2 class="header">Advantages of OOP</h2>
					<p class="style">One advantage of OOP as mentioned before<br> is avoiding repetition but some others are lowering the <br> cost of programming, and faster development. <br> Lets look at why that is. Why would in lower the cost of programming?<br> Well once a programmer writes an object they and keep <br> it in there library to re-use again saving there time<br> and employers money to re-write that code. That also helps the programmer<br> develop new programs faster because he is able to <br> re-use that code as well. For example thats say a programmer <br> is tasked with this huge project. But the <br>programmer has a large library of code that he has already written<br> he is able to use what he has already written<br> and put that together to create this new program.<br> Bein able to re-use that code has just saved Time, Money, and he was<br> able to avoid repetition in the process. Also with so much <br> open source code available now even new programmers are<br> able to take advantage of the the benefit og OOP.
					</p>
				<h2 class="header">OOP Vocabulary</h2>
					<p class"style">
						<ol>
			   				<li class="list">Object - Objects contain two things data and procedures.<br> What an Object does is take the data and runs<br> the procedures on the data prodecing an output. </li><br>
			   				<li class="list">Instance - is a specific realization of any object. An object may<br> be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that <br>object is an instance.</li><br>
							
								<li class="list">Class - is the blueprint or template used for creating objects. </li><br>
							
								<li class="list">Method - is a programmed procedure that is defined as part of a <br>class and included in any object of that class. </li><br>
								<li class="list">Module - is how we would define a class. Basically giving it a name. <br> Then you use an import statement you are <br> importing a Module. </li><br>
								<li class="list">Library - is where you would store your<br> objects. So that you are able to re-use them. </li><br>
					  </ol>
					</p>
				<h2 class="header">Abstraction</h2>
					<p class="style">First what is Abstraction? Abstraction is a very <br>difficult to understand.  Abstraction is the understanding of,<br> what something is. Think of it like this you have code and <br> it turns on a light. Now you do not need to know how it turns on <br> the light just that it does. You are now able refer to it in your <br> code by using it as a method when you need to use it. <br>
					Put as simply as I can it is knowing what code does on the outside<br> without knowing how it works on the inside. It is <br>used for OOP and it can be used for writing CSS and HTML. It is <br>used in CSS and HTML by how we define HTML sytle by using Classes <br>and defining that style in CSS. For example wanted to write a <br>book using HTML I could define a style for how I want each chaper <br>to look like by creating a class "Chaper" in CSS how I want 
					<br>it to look. Then when in quote that style in my HTML it will 
					<br>all look that way. Saving the programmer from re-writing that 
					<br>over and over again for each chaper.

			<h1 class="title" id="8">Lesson 8 - Servers</h1>
				<h2 class="header">Server</h2>
					<p class="style">What is a server? That is a question some may not even ask because you might have an idea<br> As to what is is already. But Servers are I bit more complicated.<br> A Server is a computer program that handles requests from computers <br> outside to the inside. So what does that mean? Think of it like <br> A server at a restaurant you want a dish form the kitchen so you tell the <br> server then the server runs back to the kitchen and tells <br> the chief. Then the chief prepares you dish gives it to the server and the <br> server then runs back and gives you the dish. <br> So for computers it is that same thing. You &#40;the  client&#41; tell the server <br>you want a certian file runs to the database you <br> want that file the database finds it and then gives it to the server and the server <br> sends it back to you. Most people if you were to <br> ask them would probably get a server and database confused. But just remember that a <br> Database store the information and the <br> server is how you get the information back and forth. An example of that would be when a <br>
					server handles a GET request. A GET request <br> is where someone wants information from the server. An example would be you you wanting <br> to click to another page on a website the server <br> see&#39;s that as a GET request and then sends you that new page. One other type <br> of request a server handles is a POST request. What a POST<br> request does is change information on the server. An example of that would <br>
					be on the comments section of this website. <br> You put in your information and the server POST&#39;s it in the database. The comments <br>
					section is cool because it also has a GET request <br> getting the information you submitted so you can see it.  
					</p>
				<h2 class="header">Validating</h2>
					<p class="style">Validating is verifying &#40;through the server&#41; that only information you requested<br> is given. For example users submitting data through forms. <br> It would check to make sure that you have given correct email&#44; phone number&#44; and address. <br> What is is for is helping you see that you are getting real information <br>and it is not wrong also to make sure that it is not <br> malicious or someone trying to break your website&#44; database&#44; or computer.<br> That  type of validation is good for security <br> one other type is heplful to enhance  the user experience. An example of that would be you<br> getting an error message when submitting 
					information on a form letting you know<br> something you typed as not correct.  Validation is used for almost every website their  is out there.  
					</p>
				<h2 class="header">HTML Templates</h2>
					<p class="style">HTML Templates is kind of a basic concept to understand. It is saying that <br> you are able to have code you wrote and use it again for someone else. <br> But using Templates take advantage of two major concepts in programming<br> Avoiding Repetition&#44; andAbstraction. It allows you to avoid repetition by reusing your code<br > over again without have to rewrite it. It allows you to use the <br>concept of Abstraction by letting you use someone elses code for projects<br> to save you time and money as well as trying to figuring out how <br> to write code someone else has already figured out. One way templtes <br> help you avoid repetition is by a concept called Template inheritance.<br> Template inheritance is where you might have a header and footer for your site but<br>have multiple pages  so each page you have would inherent the header and footer. What that does<br> is allow you not to have to re&#45;write that over again avoiding repetition and <br> keeping the look the same while avoiding errors.
